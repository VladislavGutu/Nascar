Thanks for purchasing this asset.

Go to "Tools -> Sync Layers" in the menu bar to sync the necessary layers.

Texture sizes you see in the project are my recommendation for all types of target device.
However! If you want more quality, You can increase it in texture import settings.

When building APK, Make sure you have Vertex Compression* off on "Tex Coord 0", You can find it in Edit > Project Settings > Player. 

Re-Bake Occlusion Culling and lighting, if you see Corrupted lightmaps or high batches.

Add Camera&Car_Mobile.prefab from prefab folder into the scene, Don't forget to delete additional camera in Hierarchy.
